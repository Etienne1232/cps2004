//The game will take place on a randomly generated 16 Ã— 16 minesweeper grid
//of cells with 40 mines. The game should allow a single player to attempt to
//clear the grid without hitting any mines.
//To clear the grid, the player must choose uncleared cells one at a time.
//When an uncleared cell is chosen, the following happens:
//    If the cell contains a mine, the player loses the game.
//    If the cell is the last uncleared cell without a mine, the player wins the
//        game.
//    If the cell does not contain a mine but has one or more adjacent mines,
//        the cell is cleared and the number of adjacent mines is shown.
